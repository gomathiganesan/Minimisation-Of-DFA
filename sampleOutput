Minimizing the DFA
State A is equivalent to state B
State A is equivalent to state C
State B is equivalent to state A
State B is equivalent to state C
State C is equivalent to state A
State C is equivalent to state B
State D is equivalent to state E
State E is equivalent to state D
The transition table is
State	Input 'a'  Input 'b'
A	      A	        A
D	      D	        D
